The interface use "specle.mat". It is the file that contains all the specles pattern that we can create with the SLM.
You can download this file here (large file): https://filesender.renater.fr/?s=download&token=e80449f1-428b-41fc-94e6-7ee62c0d78b3

Make sure that "speckle.mat" and the interface luncher are in the same folder.
